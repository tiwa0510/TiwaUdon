### Sample Scene explanation
1. Please open the sample scene. ("Assets\TiwaUdon\Udonco\Core\Sample Scene\Sample.unity")
2. The sample scene contains a sample that changes the active state of a game object from several triggers.
3. Look at the U# script for "UdoncoInteracetEvent" attached to an object named "Interact"
4. "Invokers" contains a small Udon script to switch the active state of game objects.
5. When the Interact event is fired, the specified method of the Udon registered with the Invoker will be called.
6. Let's launch the sample scene and check it out.

#### Create New Command

2. From the right-click menu, select „Äå Create->Udonco Command U# Script „Äç and choose a file name.
3. Open the newly created U# file and rename the "CustomEvent" method to the appropriate name.
